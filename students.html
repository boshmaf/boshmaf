      <p>A very warm welcome to you, <b>dear Student.</b> Thank you for your interest! By choosing to conduct scientific research, as compared to other things in life, you embark on an exiting journey of exploration and discovery. Like all pursuits that matter, it is a long, sometimes frustrating journey, but is one that is generous, humbling, and extremely rewarding.</p>

      <p>I have put together a bunch of useful content in this page that I found valuable when I was working towards my degrees. I would skim through this content <em>before</em> exploring current research, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities, which are equally important to me. Enjoy!</p>
